I should think about other ways to incorporate a model as I go through the papers.

Implement DeepMind algorithm:
    - Figure out how ALE structures rewards

    - Turn algorithm into code

    - Check Nature paper for parameters not in the original paper (specific reLU function, for one). Page 10 has all the constant parameters.

    - Should I be softmaxing the output layer? I'm not doing it currently. I guess epsilon-greedy exploration makes this irrelevant.

    - Implement the loss function
