I should think about other ways to incorporate a model as I go through the papers.

Implement DeepMind algorithm:
    - Make sure I can run ALE
        - Figure out how ALE structures rewards
    - Hook up TensorFlow with ALE. That is, figure out how to take a stack of images in the ALE output format and input them to a TensorFlow CNN.
    - Figure out RGB->grayscale implementation
    - Turn algorithm into code
