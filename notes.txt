Starting a little late, but that's ok. What are the steps I need to take for an MVP?

    - I should probably skim the paper I'm working off of again, just to refresh my memory.
    - A good starting place would be to replicate the result in that paper, or at least their setup. For that, I need:
        - ALE fully running, with at least one ROM
        - TensorFlow in the most current release, and able to interface with ALE
        - The algorithm from the paper implemented

Let's start with TensorFlow.
Looks like it's working after a simple pip install --upgrade. Somehow that was easier than last time I installed it. I seem to remember having trouble using it in ipython but it works fine now.

Skim the paper?
I think I remember most of the exploration paper now. I also need to go back through the paper I presented, though, because that had most of the details on how to actually do Q-learning.

Maybe a better first step is to replicate the original 2013 DeepMind paper, then add in the model.
Hopefully TensorFlow lets me one-up the original paper by not needing the cropping they used to fit in with the 2D conv library.

Problem: My idea of using the model output as a parallel input into the Q-network doesn't really work, because the Q-network gives outputs for each action and a transition model requires an action as an input. That would mean I would have to instead train Q-networks for each possible action, which is almost definitely not a reasonable thing to attempt given the hardware I'm working with.

Idea: Put the model outputs for each of the actions as an input in the Q-network at the level where the action outputs diverge. Not sure how easy this is in TensorFlow, but probably feasible.

DeepMind algorithm implementation considerations:
    - Need to decide if I'm copying their frame-skipping. Probably good to start with.
    - They convert RGB to grey-scale. TensorFlow probably can't do that. I'll have to find some appropriate Python library, or maaaaaaybe ALE has a built-in capability. A quick search through their github isn't promising.
        - scikit-image looks like a good candidate for a python library

My current overall task is going through ALE and figuring out what it expects as input and output at each step of the process.

Couldn't immediately find a ROM for Pong
Have six of the seven ROMs, now I'm going to figure out how to load them.
